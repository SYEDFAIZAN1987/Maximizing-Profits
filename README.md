## 📘 About the Project

This project focuses on **optimizing inventory levels** for a northern hardware company planning to expand operations by opening a distribution center in the southeastern region. By leveraging **linear programming**, the project identifies the optimal quantities of four products—pressure washers, go-karts, generators, and water pumps—to maximize profits while adhering to constraints on budget, warehouse space, and marketing requirements.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

1. **Develop and Solve a Linear Programming Model**:
   - Maximize net profits by optimizing inventory levels.
   - Ensure adherence to budget, space, and marketing constraints.
   
2. **Conduct Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Assess the impact of budget and space changes on profit.
   - Determine thresholds for selling prices and inventory levels.

3. **Provide Actionable Insights**:
   - Recommend strategies to improve profitability and operational efficiency.

## 📊 Key Results

- **Optimal Inventory Levels**:
  - Pressure Washers: 0 units
  - Go-Karts: 155 units
  - Generators: 238 units
  - Water Pumps: 119 cases
- **Total Monthly Profit**: $142,050.70

### Recommendations:
1. **Increase Budget**:
   - Allocating an additional $428.8 increases profit by $239.04.
2. **Expand Warehouse Space**:
   - Increasing space by 6,078 sq. ft. boosts profit by $23,350.07.
3. **Adjust Selling Prices**:
   - Pressure washers should only be stocked if the selling price is raised to at least $280.07.
